# I-stand-with-you-using-Emojis-to-study-Solidarity-in-Crisis-Events is a twitter solidarity analysis project completed by Suvam Das (project head), Priyam Mukherjee, and Shawan Basu under the guidance of Mrs. Paramita Dey.
Emojis are very common in social media and understanding their underlying semantics is of great interest from machine learning and natural language processing point of view. In this project, emojis have been used for sentiment analysis in order to discern the subjective opinion of a crisis event through a social media platform, that is, Twitter. The crisis event that have been taken into account is #AyodhyaVerdict. For collecting the data, a simple Twitter Application was build using twitter api. With the help of the credentials(consumer key, consumer secret key, access token, access token secret) the tweets were streamed and stored in a .csv file. Recognition of the emojis and setting Sentiment rankings were done accordingly. With the help of data preprocessing, the raw data was transformed into a useful and efficient format for cluster building and thus calculating Final Centroids, Accuracy for indiviadual Emojis, Average Accuracy score .
